## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement

1. **Limited Data Availability**:
   - Current blockchain oracles primarily focus on simple data types like price feeds, timestamps, or event triggers.
   - Educational blockchain projects often require **complex datasets** that cater to specific academic or research needs.

2. **AI x Blockchain Challenges**:
   - AI models rely on **high-quality, structured training data**, which is difficult to obtain in decentralized systems.
   - There‚Äôs no unified platform providing **on-chain data** curated for AI training.

3. **Developer Friction**:
   - Existing blockchain tools require significant setup and maintenance, deterring developers from creating innovative solutions.
